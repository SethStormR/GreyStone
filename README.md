GreyStone is an icon theme that goes well with Graphite theme (Dark). The icon theme is available for KDE, Gnome and Budgie DE. XFCE support will be added in the near future.

It's highly recommendable to use it with vinceliuice's Graphite Dark theme which can be downloaded here: https://store.kde.org/p/1667594

GreyStone icon theme uses Kora icon theme as foundation and elements of it will be present in the icon theme.

Tested on: Solus KDE/Gnome/Budgie - Fedora KDE/Gnome/Budgie - Zorin OS 17 Pro/core
